# Building AI Agents for Finance

Code repository for *Building AI Agents for Finance* (Packt, 2026).

Each chapter folder contains one or more hands-on Jupyter notebooks
named `chapter_<N>_lab_<M>_<topic>.ipynb`. Several chapters also ship
a `common.py` with shared models, helpers, and sample data that the
notebooks import; the notebooks auto-download `common.py` on first
run in Colab.

## Running the labs

### In Google Colab (recommended)

Each notebook is designed to run end-to-end in Colab. Open the
notebook, and when prompted for an API key, add it via the **key**
icon in Colab's left sidebar using the exact name listed in the
notebook (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`). The notebooks read keys with
`google.colab.userdata.get(...)`.

### Locally

1. Copy [`.env.sample`](./.env.sample) to `.env` and fill in the keys
   you need (each section lists which labs use which key).
2. Install the per-lab packages with the `%pip install` cell at the
   top of each notebook.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter / VS Code / your editor of choice.

The notebooks wrap the Colab import in `try / except ImportError` and
fall back to reading from the environment when running locally.
